## Milestone 3: Guess Checking

In this milestone, the program now asks the user to guess a letter and checks whether that letter is in the randomly chosen word. Input validation is handled using a function that ensures the user enters a single alphabetical character. The guess checking is also handled in a separate function for better organisation.

### How to Run

## Milestone 4: Hangman Class with Game Logic

This milestone introduces object-oriented programming to structure the game using a class.

### What's Implemented

- A `Hangman` class with the following:
  - Word selection from a given word list
  - Input validation through the `ask_for_input()` method
  - Letter checking and word progress updates using `check_guess()`
  - Lives system with feedback for correct and incorrect guesses
  - Tracking previously guessed letters
